# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I just consolidated some of my knowledge of CSS by creating the beginnings of a cheat sheet for the CSS diner game. 

**Thoughts:** There were a few things I didn't quite understand in class today, but doing it again at my own pace helped clear those issues up.


### Day 2: April 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Went over and cleaned up my notes about git from the afternoon workshop. Tried to further my knowledge of CSS by adding animation to my koala (see style.css sheet in this repo). 

**Thoughts:** Annoyingly, can't figure out why the animation that I applied to the koala nose has also been added to the background. I've had a long look at it and have decided to give it a rest for today - maybe a fresh pair of eyes tomorrow will help.


### Day 3: April 27, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Got a second pair of eyes on my koala code and we managed to fix my error! Didn't write any more code today. Just spent time going through my notes from today's bootcamp. 

**Thoughts:** Really happy about the koala code. I'm a bit annoyed that I didn't get enough time to practise some Javascript after going through my notes, but hopefully will have some more time tomorrow.
