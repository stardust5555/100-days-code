# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I just consolidated some of my knowledge of CSS by creating the beginnings of a cheat sheet for the CSS diner game. 

**Thoughts:** There were a few things I didn't quite understand in class today, but doing it again at my own pace helped clear those issues up.


### Day 2: April 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Went over and cleaned up my notes about git from the afternoon workshop. Tried to further my knowledge of CSS by adding animation to my koala (see style.css sheet in this repo). 

**Thoughts:** Annoyingly, can't figure out why the animation that I applied to the koala nose has also been added to the background. I've had a long look at it and have decided to give it a rest for today - maybe a fresh pair of eyes tomorrow will help.


### Day 3: April 27, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Got a second pair of eyes on my koala code and we managed to fix my error! Didn't write any more code today. Just spent time going through my notes from today's bootcamp. 

**Thoughts:** Really happy about the koala code. I'm a bit annoyed that I didn't get enough time to practise some Javascript after going through my notes, but hopefully will have some more time tomorrow. 


### Day 4: April 28, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Just been messing around with functions and objects.

**Thoughts:** I feel better about objects, dot notation and bracket notation. But I'm still struggling with functions.


### Day 5: April 29, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Spent most of the day doing the hackathon for the rock, paper and scissors game. 

**Thoughts:** I feel better A LOT better about Javascript and functions in general. Some of it is still swimmming around my head, but the hackathon experience was really good for me. It was also really good for me to be driving the code. Also, I got to know my teammates better -  that was the best part. We really started to get in the groove on Friday, it's a shame we won't be in a team next week. At the same time, I think I've learnt a lot about how to work in a team and look forward to meeting my new programming pair. 


### Day 6: April 30, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Started going through the old workshops, but was mainly just tidying up/going over my notes, because I'm finding that I have to look things up quite often. 

**Thoughts:** 


### Day 7: May 1, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Started my work on Codewars today. Got really stuck on one of the problems. I've tried so many different variations of code and I still can't figure it out. 

**Thoughts:** It's getting pretty late, so I'm going to stop coding and see if I can tackle the problem tomorrow morning. Maybe I need to consolidate my knowledge of Javascript a bit better before I try and tackle the problem again. 


### Day 8: May 2, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Still stuck on that CodeWars problem! I think I need to ask for help - or ask a fellow bootcamper. I just carried on with the other Codewars problems and made more notes. 

**Thoughts:** I'm a bit worried that I'm not good at logic andd functions. Other people seem to be catching on a lot faster than me. I'm hoping that it will become easier with practise. 



### Day 9: May 2, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Learnt about DOMs. Tried to complete the DOM workshop - and I couldn't get anywhere. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled today. I don't understand this at all. And I just feel too tired to carry on working. I don't know how tomorrow will go given that I don't understand what went on today. 


### Day 10: May 3, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Learnt about APIs and fetch function. Worked through the fetch workshop from scratch after 5pm.

**Thoughts:** I'm still confused. But I do feel a little better today. When I'm with my group I feel like I'm drowning, but when I have time at the end of he day t ogo over things we've learnt at my own pace I feel better. Originally, I was trying to finish off the tasks in the workshop but then I'd keep getting really stuck. I've found starting the workshops from scratch by myself has actually helped me figure out what's going on. The thing I'm worried about is that I find it easier working by myself than with my group becasue I can go at my own pace. But obviously in industry you need to work with other people all of the time, so I'm not sure how I should tackle that problem.  


### Day 11: May 5, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Learnt more about fetch and APIs, as well as how to create interactive buttons. Spent most of the day working with my group (JLS) on problems. 

**Thoughts:** I feel a lot better today. We stopped doing LiveShare and instead took it in turn to share screens. This style of working is a lot better for me - I found it really difficult to concentrate on what was happening when we were using LiveShare. I found today that I've been speaking up more and asking to break things down when I'm struggling. I'm getting on a lot better with my team and there's more of a flow.


### Day 12: May 6, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Hacakthon Friday! We went back to using LiveShare again today. We created a webpage abotu "Dad jokes". We fetched jokes from an API. WE created a button that the user could click so that a new joke would appear. I spent most of my time working on creating a "Dad" - similar to when we created the koala using CSS and HTML. I also added animation to my creation. 

**Thoughts:** Even though we're using LiveShare, I'm working really well with my team today. We split up the tasks instead of all working on every task together. I'm not sure if were supposed to do that, but it worked for our team. I think working on CSS and HTML was a really good refresher for me, because I had already forgotten much of the stuff we did at the start of week 1. I mainly struggled with positioning things in the correct place. I had to rely a lot on Google and other people's code online for my design. I think I'd really liek o be in a position were I can think of a design and know how to create it without too much help from the internet. I just need to find the time outside of the bootcamp to set up my own repo and get cracking. 


### Day 13: May 7, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Started the Week 2 recap tasks. Finished Task 1 and Task 2. 

**Thoughts:** It took me a lot longer than I thought it would. I think because I was really taking my time with my plan. Also, I got distracted a few times. But the difficulty of the tasks weren't too bad. I need to make clear notes on this week's topics though.


### Day 14: May 8, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Got really stuck on task 3. It was about fetching cat images. I just couldn't figure out how to parse the data that I had fetched from the API, because it was a Blob rather than a JSON. I spent a couple of hours on that one task and had to give up in the end. I've sent it to my mentor, so hopefully he can clear that up for me on Tuesday. I think I'm having trouble understanding what a Blob is. I also did half of the Bonus, but I ran out of time.  

**Thoughts:** Today was tough. I was demoralised about being stuck on Task 3 for so long and not getting anywhere. I felt like I wasted my weekend. But hopefully when I figure out why my code was wrong it will be worth it. I think I get bogged down by the small stuff. I need to learn when to quit and move on. I'm a little upset that I didn't have any time to write up my notes - becasue writing up notes always helps me when I go into the next week.


### Day 14: May 9, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Learn about UX and UI today. Today was quite relaxed - we didn't do much coding. We did however, do the !Lights challenge where we had to use HTML and CSS to design the Google homepage without using the internet for help. I completely failed. 

**Thoughts:** I have really realised how much I rely on the internet. I hope that it's because I'm out of practise rather that it being that I'm not retaining anything. Today was a relaxed day which was nice. I was really struggling to enagage when we were in groups and with my partner today - so I want to work on that tomorrow. 


### Day 15: May 10, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Learnt about UX design and UI. Spent most of the day discussing things with my partner rather than coding. Although at the beginning of the day we did a little bit of Codewars and towards the end of the day we touched on CSS variables, in particular ":root".  

**Thoughts:** Today was another relaxed day. I enjoyed learning about CSS variables the most. My partner and I didn't manage to finish the workshop in class so I finished it later on in the day. I learnt about the toggle function in Javascript which is really useful. The hardest part of the day was probabaly Codewars. I kept overcomplcating the problem. Going forward I'd like to spend some time playing with Codewars.
Also, I managed to finish Task 3 of the recap tasks! I had my mentor meeting today and he cleared up where I was going wrong. It was really useful to have a one-on-one discussion. I was struggling with the difference between blob and JSON, but my mentor really broke it down for me and it was a really productive hour.
