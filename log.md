# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I just consolidated some of my knowledge of CSS by creating the beginnings of a cheat sheet for the CSS diner game. 

**Thoughts:** There were a few things I didn't quite understand in class today, but doing it again at my own pace helped clear those issues up.


### Day 2: April 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Went over and cleaned up my notes about git from the afternoon workshop. Tried to further my knowledge of CSS by adding animation to my koala (see style.css sheet in this repo). 

**Thoughts:** Annoyingly, can't figure out why the animation that I applied to the koala nose has also been added to the background. I've had a long look at it and have decided to give it a rest for today - maybe a fresh pair of eyes tomorrow will help.


### Day 3: April 27, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Got a second pair of eyes on my koala code and we managed to fix my error! Didn't write any more code today. Just spent time going through my notes from today's bootcamp. 

**Thoughts:** Really happy about the koala code. I'm a bit annoyed that I didn't get enough time to practise some Javascript after going through my notes, but hopefully will have some more time tomorrow. 

### Day 4: April 28, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Just been messing around with functions and objects.

**Thoughts:** I feel better about objects, dot notation and bracket notation. But I'm still struggling with functions.

### Day 5: April 29, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Spent most of the day doing the hackathon for the rock, paper and scissors game. 

**Thoughts:** I feel better A LOT better about Javascript and functions in general. Some of it is still swimmming around my head, but the hackathon experience was really good for me. It was also really good for me to be driving the code. Also, I got to know my teammates better -  that was the best part. We really started to get in the groove on Friday, it's a shame we won't be in a team next week. At the same time, I think I've learnt a lot about how to work in a team and look forward to meeting my new programming pair. 

### Day 6: April 30, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Started going through the old workshops, but was mainly just tidying up/going over my notes, because I'm finding that I have to look things up quite often. 

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 7: May 1, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Started my work on Codewars today. Got really stuck on one of the problems. I've tried so many different variations of code and I still can't figure it out. 

**Thoughts:** It's getting pretty late, so I'm going to stop coding and see if I can tackle the problem tomorrow morning. Maybe I need to consolidate my knowledge of Javascript a bit better before I try and tackle the problem again.
