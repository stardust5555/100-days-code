# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I just consolidated some of my knowledge of CSS by creating the beginnings of a cheat sheet for the CSS diner game. 

**Thoughts:** There were a few things I didn't quite understand in class today, but doing it again at my own pace helped clear those issues up.


### Day 2: April 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Went over and cleaned up my notes about git from the afternoon workshop. Tried to further my knowledge of CSS by adding animation to my koala (see style.css sheet in this repo). 

**Thoughts:** Annoyingly, can't figure out why the animation that I applied to the koala nose has also been added to the background. I've had a long look at it and have decided to give it a rest for today - maybe a fresh pair of eyes tomorrow will help.


### Day 3: April 27, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Got a second pair of eyes on my koala code and we managed to fix my error! Didn't write any more code today. Just spent time going through my notes from today's bootcamp. 

**Thoughts:** Really happy about the koala code. I'm a bit annoyed that I didn't get enough time to practise some Javascript after going through my notes, but hopefully will have some more time tomorrow. 


### Day 4: April 28, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Just been messing around with functions and objects.

**Thoughts:** I feel better about objects, dot notation and bracket notation. But I'm still struggling with functions.


### Day 5: April 29, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Spent most of the day doing the hackathon for the rock, paper and scissors game. 

**Thoughts:** I feel better A LOT better about Javascript and functions in general. Some of it is still swimmming around my head, but the hackathon experience was really good for me. It was also really good for me to be driving the code. Also, I got to know my teammates better -  that was the best part. We really started to get in the groove on Friday, it's a shame we won't be in a team next week. At the same time, I think I've learnt a lot about how to work in a team and look forward to meeting my new programming pair. 


### Day 6: April 30, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Started going through the old workshops, but was mainly just tidying up/going over my notes, because I'm finding that I have to look things up quite often. 

**Thoughts:** 


### Day 7: May 1, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Started my work on Codewars today. Got really stuck on one of the problems. I've tried so many different variations of code and I still can't figure it out. 

**Thoughts:** It's getting pretty late, so I'm going to stop coding and see if I can tackle the problem tomorrow morning. Maybe I need to consolidate my knowledge of Javascript a bit better before I try and tackle the problem again. 


### Day 8: May 2, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Still stuck on that CodeWars problem! I think I need to ask for help - or ask a fellow bootcamper. I just carried on with the other Codewars problems and made more notes. 

**Thoughts:** I'm a bit worried that I'm not good at logic andd functions. Other people seem to be catching on a lot faster than me. I'm hoping that it will become easier with practise. 



### Day 9: May 2, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Learnt about DOMs. Tried to complete the DOM workshop - and I couldn't get anywhere. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled today. I don't understand this at all. And I just feel too tired to carry on working. I don't know how tomorrow will go given that I don't understand what went on today. 


### Day 10: May 3, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Learnt about APIs and fetch function. Worked through the fetch workshop from scratch after 5pm.

**Thoughts:** I'm still confused. But I do feel a little better today. When I'm with my group I feel like I'm drowning, but when I have time at the end of he day t ogo over things we've learnt at my own pace I feel better. Originally, I was trying to finish off the tasks in the workshop but then I'd keep getting really stuck. I've found starting the workshops from scratch by myself has actually helped me figure out what's going on. The thing I'm worried about is that I find it easier working by myself than with my group becasue I can go at my own pace. But obviously in industry you need to work with other people all of the time, so I'm not sure how I should tackle that problem.  


### Day 11: May 5, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Learnt more about fetch and APIs, as well as how to create interactive buttons. Spent most of the day working with my group (JLS) on problems. 

**Thoughts:** I feel a lot better today. We stopped doing LiveShare and instead took it in turn to share screens. This style of working is a lot better for me - I found it really difficult to concentrate on what was happening when we were using LiveShare. I found today that I've been speaking up more and asking to break things down when I'm struggling. I'm getting on a lot better with my team and there's more of a flow.


### Day 12: May 6, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Hacakthon Friday! We went back to using LiveShare again today. We created a webpage abotu "Dad jokes". We fetched jokes from an API. WE created a button that the user could click so that a new joke would appear. I spent most of my time working on creating a "Dad" - similar to when we created the koala using CSS and HTML. I also added animation to my creation. 

**Thoughts:** Even though we're using LiveShare, I'm working really well with my team today. We split up the tasks instead of all working on every task together. I'm not sure if were supposed to do that, but it worked for our team. I think working on CSS and HTML was a really good refresher for me, because I had already forgotten much of the stuff we did at the start of week 1. I mainly struggled with positioning things in the correct place. I had to rely a lot on Google and other people's code online for my design. I think I'd really liek o be in a position were I can think of a design and know how to create it without too much help from the internet. I just need to find the time outside of the bootcamp to set up my own repo and get cracking. 


### Day 13: May 7, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Started the Week 2 recap tasks. Finished Task 1 and Task 2. 

**Thoughts:** It took me a lot longer than I thought it would. I think because I was really taking my time with my plan. Also, I got distracted a few times. But the difficulty of the tasks weren't too bad. I need to make clear notes on this week's topics though.


### Day 14: May 8, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Got really stuck on task 3. It was about fetching cat images. I just couldn't figure out how to parse the data that I had fetched from the API, because it was a Blob rather than a JSON. I spent a couple of hours on that one task and had to give up in the end. I've sent it to my mentor, so hopefully he can clear that up for me on Tuesday. I think I'm having trouble understanding what a Blob is. I also did half of the Bonus, but I ran out of time.  

**Thoughts:** Today was tough. I was demoralised about being stuck on Task 3 for so long and not getting anywhere. I felt like I wasted my weekend. But hopefully when I figure out why my code was wrong it will be worth it. I think I get bogged down by the small stuff. I need to learn when to quit and move on. I'm a little upset that I didn't have any time to write up my notes - becasue writing up notes always helps me when I go into the next week.


### Day 14: May 9, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Learn about UX and UI today. Today was quite relaxed - we didn't do much coding. We did however, do the !Lights challenge where we had to use HTML and CSS to design the Google homepage without using the internet for help. I completely failed. 

**Thoughts:** I have really realised how much I rely on the internet. I hope that it's because I'm out of practise rather that it being that I'm not retaining anything. Today was a relaxed day which was nice. I was really struggling to enagage when we were in groups and with my partner today - so I want to work on that tomorrow. 


### Day 15: May 10, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Learnt about UX design and UI. Spent most of the day discussing things with my partner rather than coding. Although at the beginning of the day we did a little bit of Codewars and towards the end of the day we touched on CSS variables, in particular ":root". Had my mentor meeting - we went over Task 3 of the recap workshop (fetching images from the cat API).

**Thoughts:** Today was another relaxed day. I enjoyed learning about CSS variables the most. My partner and I didn't manage to finish the workshop in class so I finished it later on in the day. I learnt about the toggle function in Javascript which is really useful. The hardest part of the day was probabaly Codewars. I kept overcomplcating the problem. Going forward I'd like to spend some time playing with Codewars.
Also, I managed to finish Task 3 of the recap tasks! I had my mentor meeting today and he cleared up where I was going wrong. It was really useful to have a one-on-one discussion. I was struggling with the difference between blob and JSON, but my mentor really broke it down for me and it was a really productive hour.



### Day 16: May 11, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Spent the day learning about UI. Including resources such as miro and Figma. However, we didn't get very far with Figma - especially compared to other people in the bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** I really love miro. It's so clean and easy to use. However, I found Figma really difficult to navigate. Going forward I definitely want to spend time practising and messing around with Figma so I can get used to it and use it quickly. I think Figma is such a useful tool and I really like design so I definitely want to start creating a portfolio.


### Day 17: May 12, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Worked with another team. Practised our Figma and Miro skills. We were given a brief to design a few pages of an app similar to Google Maps.

**Thoughts:** I found that today really taught me how different and sometimes difficult it is to work with Figma collaboratively. I struggled with everyone working on the same thing at the same time. Definitely something I want to get better at. I think today has also taught me the importance of a plan, especially when working with other people. As sometimes I lost track of what we were doing and I know other pople in our group felt the same way.


### Day 18: May 13, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Hacakthon Friday! Mubeen and I created a website designed finding piano tutors and signing up to be a piano tutor. We brought all of our skills together, using Jamboard, Hubspot, Miro and Figma. 

**Thoughts:** I actually started on the Hackathon project yesterday night before, and I think that put us in really good stead. I know that it made my partner feel a lot better going into the day. Today really consolidated my knowledge of Miro an Figma. I feel a lot better using Figma now, and I definitely want to keep using Figma to desgin my own projects. It feels a lot less daunting. 



### Day 19: May 14, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Started the weekend recap task - design a website all about me.

**Thoughts:** One of the hardest things was thinking about what I wanted to say about me, and what I wanted the design to look like, rather than actually creating it in Figma. Jamboard has been a really great tool today as well as HUbspot, becasue they really helped me step back and think about the UX side of the things, not just UI and how the website will look.

### Day 20: May 15, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Finally finished designing my website!

**Thoughts:** This task took me really long time. But I really enjoyed every second of it. I really like FIgma now and I really like designing websites. I think it's going to be really difficult when it comes to actually coding it, but I really need the practise and I think it will be good for me.

### Day 21: May 16, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Introduction to Node.js. And the realtionship of client and server. 

**Thoughts:** Today was intense. I really need to take time to figure out what's going on.

### Day 22: May 17, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Learnt about express and how to import and export different files.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I don't know what's going on. I don't know how people are catching on so quickly. My mentor meeting today was actually really helpful. We spoke a little bit about what express is used for. I do want to go into next week's meeting and be able to articulate my questions better, so I can get the full benefit of my mentor's help.

### Day 23: May 18, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Carried on with our back-end workshop. Started looking a bit more into routers. 

**Thoughts:** All I can say is, is that I'm so grateful for my partner!

### Day 24: May 19, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Carried on with our back-end workshop. Learnt about CRUD.

**Thoughts:** I feel a little better about today. But I still get really anxious about the thought of being picked on. I'm still struggling with the code. But I feel a lot better about the concept. I think Liz's diagram about how the server, client, request, response relationship works really helped me today.

### Day 25: May 20, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Hackathon Friday.

**Thoughts:** I think the Hackathon today really helped me. I feel a lot better about get and post requests. But i need to sit down and really take the ime to go through put and delete requests at the weekend. My partner was really helpful in terms of breaking things down today. I also think the hackathon really helped me bond with my partner as well.

### Day 26: May 21, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Recap tasks - back end - get and post request.

**Thoughts:** I'm taking it really slow today. I really want to understand as much as I can. I feel a lot better about get and post requests now. I think one of the things that was annoying me, was that I was trying to to understand everything - the concept, every bit of code, the syntax. But I think I need to learn to be satisfied with not knowing everything. Because at the end of the day I made a get request and a post request with a bit of help from my partner and google and hopefully with more practise I'll be able to do it all by myself. But I don't necessarily need to understand everything to get there.

### Day 27: May 22, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Recap tasks - back end - delete and put requests.

**Thoughts:** I finished! It took me a long time because I didn't understand what was going on during the week, but I got there. I'm not totally sure that my delete request is right, but I might ask my mentor about that on Tuesday. The only thing I'm really struggling with is converting Common JS is ESM and vice versa. Really struggling with that.

### Day 28: May 23, 2022
**Today's Progress:** Guest speaker (Kyle Simpson). Learnt the basics of SQL. Learnt about SELECT, WHERE, INSERT INTO and UPDATE. As well as SQL syntax e.g. you use single quotation marks for a string, not double. 

**Thoughts:** Today was nice and manageable. I was worried that it was going to be intense, but it a good day.
